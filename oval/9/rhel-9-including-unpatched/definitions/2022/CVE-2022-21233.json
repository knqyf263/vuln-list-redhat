    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in hw. The APIC can operate in xAPIC mode (also known as a legacy mode), in which APIC configuration registers are exposed through a memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) page. This flaw allows an attacker who can execute code on a target CPU to query the APIC configuration page. When reading the APIC configuration page with an unaligned read from the MMIO page, the registers may return stale data from previous requests made by the same processor core to the same configuration page, leading to unauthorized access. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content and in most cases merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat ownership of development processes, QA, and documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information please contact the binary content vendor.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation baser or stability.",
