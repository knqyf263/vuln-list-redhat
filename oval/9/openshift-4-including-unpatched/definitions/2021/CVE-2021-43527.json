    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A remote code execution flaw was found in the way NSS verifies certificates. This flaw allows an attacker posing as an SSL/TLS server to trigger this issue in a client application compiled with NSS when it tries to initiate an SSL/TLS connection.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client, triggering the flaw. The highest threat to this vulnerability is confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The issue is not limited to TLS. Any applications that use NSS certificate verification are vulnerable; S/MIME is impacted as well.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client.\n\nFirefox is not vulnerable to this flaw as it uses the mozilla::pkix for certificate verification. Thunderbird is affected when parsing email with the S/MIME signature.  Thunderbird on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and later does not need to be updated since it uses the system NSS library, but earlier Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 extended life streams will need to update Thunderbird as well as NSS.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
