    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q). \n            STATEMENT: 1 For this issue to be exploitable, the (server) application using the OpenSSL library needs to use it incorrectly.\n2. There are multiple other requirements for the attack to succeed: \n    - The ciphersuite used must be obsolete CBC cipher without a stitched implementation (or the system be in FIPS mode)\n    - the attacker has to be a MITM\n    - the attacker has to be able to control the client side to send requests to the buggy server on demand\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround you can disable SHA384 if applications (compiled with OpenSSL) allow for adjustment of the ciphersuite string configuration.",
