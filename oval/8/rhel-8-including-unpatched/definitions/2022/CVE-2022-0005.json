    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in hw. Sensitive information accessible by physical probing of the JTAG interface for some Intel(R) Processors with SGX may allow an unprivileged user to disclose information via physical access. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content and in most cases merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat ownership of development processes, QA, and documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information please contact the binary content vendor.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation baser or stability.",
