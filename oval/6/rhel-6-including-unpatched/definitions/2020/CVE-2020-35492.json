    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c. This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -\u003e out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Libreoffice as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 is not affected by this flaw as it was introduced in a newer version. Also note that while the flaw was originally discovered via Libreoffice, the root cause is in the cairo graphics library. This flaw has an adjusted CVSS score for cairo as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because cairo is built with binary protections which limit the impact.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
