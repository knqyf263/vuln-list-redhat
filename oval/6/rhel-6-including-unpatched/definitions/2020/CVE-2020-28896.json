    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Mutt before 2.0.2 and NeoMutt before 2020-11-20 did not ensure that $ssl_force_tls was processed if an IMAP server's initial server response was invalid. The connection was not properly closed, and the code could continue attempting to authenticate. This could result in authentication credentials being exposed on an unencrypted connection, or to a machine-in-the-middle. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated the severity of this flaw as Moderate because although the Confidentiality impact is high, the attack complexity is also high as a particular attacker would at least need to coordinate social engineering a victim to connect to a bad server, and also perform a man-in-the-middle attack or perform similar interception of the connection. Please see the following page for details on Red Hat severity ratings with special attention to Moderate: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification .",
