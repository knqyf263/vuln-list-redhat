    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in xstream, a simple library used to serialize objects to XML and back again. This flaw allows a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. \n            STATEMENT: Users who follow the recommended security framework with a whitelist to limit the types to the minimum required should not be affected. XStream 1.4.18 no longer uses a blacklist by default since it cannot be secured for general purposes.\n\nOpenShift Container Platform (OCP) delivers Jenkins LTS package with bundled XStream library. Due to JEP-200 [1] and JEP-228 [2] Jenkins projects, OCP Jenkins package is not affected by this flaw.\nThis version of XStream library will be delivered in future Jenkins releases.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/200/README.adoc\n[2] https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc#security\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [Red Hat solution Article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7002450) explaining this issue.\n\nOpenShift Logging's Elasticsearch 6.8.1 using opendistro_security v0.10.1.2 is not affected by the vulnerable code because com.thoughtworks.xstream is only a build-time dependency.",
