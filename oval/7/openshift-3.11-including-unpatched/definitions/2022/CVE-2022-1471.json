    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the SnakeYaml package. This flaw allows an attacker to benefit from remote code execution by sending malicious YAML content and this content being deserialized by the constructor. Deserialization is unsafe and leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). \n            STATEMENT: For RHPAM, it is the user's responsibility to bring the untrusted yaml file source into RHPAM to encode it with SafeConstructor class, so the privilege required to execute the attack and the attack complexity would be high as this is not something in attacker's control, hence marking RHPAM as affected with Low impact.",
