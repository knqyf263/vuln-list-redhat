    "Multiple race conditions in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o, 1.0.0, and 1.0.0a, when multi-threading and internal caching are enabled on a TLS server, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via client data that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, related to (1) the TLS server name extension and (2) elliptic curve cryptography."
