  "statement": "This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 3, 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include\nsupport for the XFS filesystem. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5 will address this issue.",

  "details": [
    "The xfs_swapext function in fs/xfs/xfs_dfrag.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 does not properly check the file descriptors passed to the SWAPEXT ioctl, which allows local users to leverage write access and obtain read access by swapping one file into another file."
