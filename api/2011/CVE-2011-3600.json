    "The /webtools/control/xmlrpc endpoint in OFBiz XML-RPC event handler is exposed to External Entity Injection by passing DOCTYPE declarations with executable payloads that discloses the contents of files in the filesystem. In addition, it can also be used to probe for open network ports, and figure out from returned error messages whether a file exists or not. This affects OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.04."
