  "statement": "In Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.5 and 2.6 the only affected container is behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable library to authenticated users only. For Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.7 or next versions search-v2-api does not use nodejs, so is not affected for this vulnerability. therefore the impact is moderate.",
