  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. When parsing a multi-gigabyte XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault.",
    "A flaw was found in libxml2. Parsing a XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE option enabled can result in an integer overflow because safety checks were missing in some functions. Also, the xmlParseEntityValue function didn't have any length limitation."
