  "details": [
    "A denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1 and 3.0.0.1 could allow an attacker tocraft input that can cause RFC2183 multipart boundary parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.",
    "A flaw was found in rubygem-rack. Rack is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the multipart parsing component. By sending a specially-crafted input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service."
