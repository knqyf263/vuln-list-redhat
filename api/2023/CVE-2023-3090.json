  "details": [
    "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb-\u003ecb initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled. We recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.",
    "A flaw was found in the IPVLAN network driver in the Linux kernel. This issue is caused by missing skb-\u003ecb initialization in `__ip_options_echo` and can lead to an out-of-bounds write stack overflow. This may allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially achieve local privilege escalation."
