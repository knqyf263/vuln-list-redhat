    "A flaw was found in Envoy, where a specifically crafted response from an untrusted upstream service can cause a denial of service through memory exhaustion. This issue is caused by Envoyâ€™s HTTP/2 codec, which may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving RST_STREAM immediately, followed by the GOAWAY frames from an upstream server."
