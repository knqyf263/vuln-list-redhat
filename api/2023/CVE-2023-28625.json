    "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In versions 2.0.0 through 2.4.13.1, when `OIDCStripCookies` is set and a crafted cookie supplied, a NULL pointer dereference would occur, resulting in a segmentation fault. This could be used in a Denial-of-Service attack and thus presents an availability risk. Version 2.4.13.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using `OIDCStripCookies`.",
    "A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc, an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorization module for the Apache HTTP server. It is possible to trigger a NULL pointer dereference when `OIDCStripCookies` is set and a crafted `Cookie` header is supplied, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service."
