  "details": [
    "iperf3 before 3.14 allows peers to cause an integer overflow and heap corruption via a crafted length field.",
    "An integer overflow flaw was found in the way iperf3 dynamically allocates memory buffers for JSON-formatted messages. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted sequence of bytes on the iperf3 control channel with a specified JSON message length of 0xffffffff to trigger an integer overflow leading the receiving process to abort due to heap corruption. This flaw allows an attacker to use a malicious client to cause a denial of service of an iperf3 server or potentially use a malicious server to cause connecting clients to crash."
