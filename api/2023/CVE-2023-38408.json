  "details": [
    "The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.",
    "A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH. The PKCS#11 feature in the ssh-agent in OpenSSH has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system (the code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent). This flaw allows an attacker with control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ssh-agent."
