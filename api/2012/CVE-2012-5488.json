    "python_scripts.py in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1 allows remote attackers to execute Python code via a crafted URL, related to createObject.",
    "It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly protect the privilege of running RestrictedPython scripts. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would allow the attacker to submit and perform expensive computations or, in conjunction with other attacks, be able to access or alter privileged information."
