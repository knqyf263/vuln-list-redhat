  "details": [
    "Integer overflow in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large AIO iovec.",
    "It was found that AIO interface didn't use the proper rw_verify_area() helper function with extended functionality, for example, mandatory locking on the file. Also rw_verify_area() makes extended checks, for example, that the size of the access doesn't cause overflow of the provided offset limits. This integer overflow in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large AIO iovec."
