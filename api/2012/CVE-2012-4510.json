  "details": [
    "cups-pk-helper before 0.2.3 does not properly wrap the (1) cupsGetFile and (2) cupsPutFile function calls, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to read or overwrite sensitive files using CUPS resources.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the cupsGetFile() and cupsPutFile() functions of cups-pk-helper checked user IDs. If a local attacker performed a symbolic link attack, and was able to trick a CUPS administrator into approving the file transmission, the attacker could possibly use this flaw to access or modify certain system files, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
