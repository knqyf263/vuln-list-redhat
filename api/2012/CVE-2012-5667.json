  "details": [
    "Multiple integer overflows in GNU Grep before 2.11 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a long input line that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way grep parsed large lines of data. An attacker able to trick a user into running grep on a specially crafted data file could use this flaw to crash grep or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running grep."
