  "statement": "The upstream development team of the JDBC driver for the PostgreSQL database does not consider improper escaping of certain JDBC statement / query parameters, when the JDBC driver of version older than the version of underlying PostgresSQL server is being used, to be a security defect. In general, the JDBC driver for the PostgreSQL database does not promise to work with server releases newer than the driver release. The Red Hat Security Response Team agrees with their assessment and so does not consider this to be a security flaw.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with a PostgreSQL server with the \"standard_conforming_strings\" option enabled, such as the default configuration of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly escape unspecified JDBC statement parameters, which allows remote attackers to perform SQL injection attacks. NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed that the upstream developer planned to dispute this issue, but an official dispute has not been posted as of 20121005."
