    "verify.c in GnuTLS before 1.4.4, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, does not properly handle excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field when generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents GnuTLS from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS, a variant of CVE-2006-4339."
